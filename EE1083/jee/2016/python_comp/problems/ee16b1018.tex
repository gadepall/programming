From the following code, the solution to each of the above equations are $n = 12,7, 8$ and $10$ respectively. The given condition can be expressed as
%
\begin{align}
\frac{\nCr{n+2}{6}}{\nPr{n-2}{2}} &= 11 \\
\Rightarrow \frac{\brak{n+2}!}{\brak{n-4}!6!}\frac{\brak{n-4}!}{\brak{n-2}!} &= 11 \\
\Rightarrow \frac{n\brak{n-1}\brak{n+1}\brak{n+2}}{6!} &=11
\end{align}
