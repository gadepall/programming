The given circle can be expressed in standard form as
%
\begin{equation}
\brak{x-2}^2 + \brak{y+3}^2 = 5^2
\end{equation}
%
i.e., the circle has centre at $O$ with coordinates $\brak{2,-3}$ and radius 5. Using the distance formula, $OS = 5\sqrt{2}.  $Let the radius of the circle with centre at $S$ be $r$. $r$ can be obtained using Budhayana's theorem as 
%
\begin{align}
r^2 &= 5^2 + OS^2 
\\
\Rightarrow r &= 5 \sqrt{3}
\end{align}
% 
The diameter of the circle with centre $O$ and chord of circle with centre $S$ is perpendicular to OS. The equation of the diameter is thus obtained as
%
\begin{align}
\brak{y + 3} = \brak{x-2} \Rightarrow y = x -5
\end{align}
