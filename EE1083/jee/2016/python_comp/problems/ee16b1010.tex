The slope of the given line is $1$ indicating an angle of $\frac{\pi}{4}$. Thus, the coordinates of $Q$ are 
%
\begin{equation}
\brak{2 - 2\sqrt{3}\cos \frac{\pi}{4}, 1 - 2\sqrt{3}\frac{\pi}{4}} = \brak{2 - \sqrt{6}, 1 - \sqrt{6}}
\end{equation}
%
The equation of the line perpendicular to $L$ can be expressed as
%
\begin{equation}
x+y =c
\end{equation}
%
Since this line passes through $Q$, $c = 3 - 2\sqrt{6}$.
