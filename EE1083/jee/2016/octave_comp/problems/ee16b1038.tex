Let the equation of the hyperbola be
%
\begin{align}
\frac{x^2}{a^2}- \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1
\end{align}
%
Since the length of the latus rectum is 8,
%
\begin{equation}
\frac{2b^2}{a} =1
\end{equation}
%
The length of the conjugate axis is $2b$ and the distance between the foci is $2ae, e = \sqrt{1 + \frac{b^2}{a^2}}$, where $e$ is the eccentricity. Given that $2b = \frac{2ae}{2}$.
From the given information,
%
\begin{equation}
2b = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
\end{equation}
%
Since $a = 2b^2$, from the above equation, $b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $a = \frac{3}{2}$. The eccentricity
%
\begin{equation}
e = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}
\end{equation}
